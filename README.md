Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning

Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled, chaotic way. The cells keep on proliferating, producing copies that get progressively more abnormal. In most cases, the cell copies eventually end up forming a tumor.

Breast cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor originates in the breast. As breast cancer tumors mature, they may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. The primary route of metastasis is the lymphatic system which, ironically enough, is also the body's primary system for producing and transporting white blood cells and other cancer-fighting immune system cells throughout the body. Metastasized cancer cells that aren't destroyed by the lymphatic system's white blood cells move through the lymphatic vessels and settle in remote body locations, forming new tumors and perpetuating the disease process.


The Projects Features Detection of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning. It has been tested that while there exists several machine learning models,Support Vector Machine or SVM in short is reported to have highest accuracy of (approximately 97%) in detecting breast cancer.

The dataset used in this project is from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, however it can be directly accessed from Scikit learn library's collection of datasets as...

sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer

RESULTS

An accuracy of 96% was achieved by using SVM model and after normalization technique after optimisation of C and Gamma parameters it was increased to a value of a 97%.
